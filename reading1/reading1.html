    <p class="text">1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? <br><br>The most common challenge I face is not being objective enough with the works. It is very easy for me to relate the works to something completely personal and go off track of critiquing the work itself. “I really like your project” is an overused phrase I tend to say a lot unconsciously when giving a critique, yet it only sounds nice but it is meaningless for the maker of the project. Not only does it not tell anything they can improve on, it also does not tell which aspect they did well that is worth the praise. In the back of my brain there is a voice that tells me not to make any criticism because others will disagree with me and maybe they think my opinion is unacceptable and hilarious. Thus before saying anything, I have to rewind my ideas and formulate the sentence well enough to not make myself feel embarrassed of saying the wrong things. Having a balance of negative and positive feedback is tough as well. I have to be especially precise with giving constructive feedback and not use words that are offensive, or make the person feel bad in any way. In general I overly care about how others perceive my critics and intentions.     </p>

    <p class="text"> 2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?<br><br>As stated in the reading “a critique is to improve the work”. When someone critiques something I do not agree with, I will first ask them why they think that way and what are the influences on their opinion. If their reasons behind their output makes sense then I will accept the feedback to see how I can integrate it in my work to fit my philosophy. If I still completely disagree with a critique after their explanation, I would still be thankful for the time they take to critique my work. In general I remain fairly calm and peaceful even when I receive a critique that interprets my work wrongly. I think it is very normal because everyone treats the same thing differently. Based on one’s own evaluation, background and culture it will shape their judgments, giving them individuality to have independent perspectives and outputs which is the beauty of critique.</p>

    <p class="text"> 3. Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques? <br><br>
To give and to receive critiques is a great way of exchange of ideas and communication. Receiving criticism from others is an excellent way to improve one’s work and get a broader perspective of others’ opinions. It can serve as an inspiration to build upon the original piece into something more brilliant. Sometimes as a maker ourselves, we are drawn into the artwork or project we make and in turn forget about other aspects that may be influential. On the other side, when others see the work, they are observing it as an outsider, purely judging what they see, without judging the intentions of the work. Thus receiving critiques from them can pull makers back to think more rationally about their own work thus not being submerged in their isolated emotions and values. Giving critique is beneficial as well because it is a practice allowing the brain to think and analyze deeper. Overall, to give and receive critiques are valuable in all aspects  and support both the giver and the receiver to succeed further.
