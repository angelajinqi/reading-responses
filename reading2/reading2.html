    <p class="text">1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other. <br><br>
I stand for flat designs over skeuo designs when it comes to screen. Despite the idea that flat designs are better because screens are flat, when icons are vector it actually appears to have more contrast than having realistic 3D renders. From the horse example shown by the author, if all of the pictures resemble the same outcome which is to tell us it is a horse, then why not choose the simplest flat silhouette form? We can get the most out of the simplest design. This example also reminded me of the Starbucks logo evolution. Although it is flat from the beginning, it eventually took the essence of the complex and detailed mermaid into what is presented today with the same ideology. Flat designs show more clarity and are almost universal. It does not take any brain processing to analyze what the design means, as soon as one sees it, they will know by instinct because the functions of similar designs are also identical. The texture, shadows, and tones of skeuo design only offers more complexity, especially if everything is skeuo it causes more confusion for me.

    <p class="text"> 2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
<br><br> 
Zoopraxiscope is where Muybridge, a British Photographer attempts to create motion through twelve continuous photos all taken within a few seconds of time span. When he places them on a radial glass disc with light lit from behind, the action of spinning the disc creates an illusion of animated photography. Zoopraxiscope successfully became a stepping stone to today’s motion display technology. Another example that has inspired digital design is Morton Heilig’s Sensorama. In 1957, his invention of the Sensorama was a “theatre cabinet multimedia device” that created interactive experiences for users to have the senses of touch, smell, and feel along with the audio and 3D wide angle view. This hand-built machine provides body tilting, tracking winds et cetera that synchronizes with onscreen activity to allow users to fully experience the film. The Sensorama serves as an initial insight to today’s virtual reality ideation and technology.</p>

    <p class="text">3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.<br><br>


I agree that screens want “flux”. Since flux is defined as the capacity for change according to the author, designers and technicians are working to make screens want flux. The most common example to show screens wanting flux is when the light changes according to the environment to allow more vision comfort for users. The features around that all serve towards better experience of interactivity between the screen and the user. Moreover, the minor flux screen makes are already taken for granted since it seems to only work this certain way. To make screen more assistive and descriptive, the field of user experience design leverages that as their main goal to make the product ( the screen) behave relevantly to users. As a result, screens are wanting more flux because we are making it that way to add advantage to the interactive experience.
