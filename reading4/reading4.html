Why does Laurel Schwulst  advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer. <br><br>

Laurel Schwulst advocates individual websites over social media because the structure of websites are independent unlike social media with big companies behind it like Google, Facebook, Yahoo that prioritizes advertising over users’ needs. I argue with that line because corporations have an entire team made with intelligent individuals that only focuses on how to improve their software to better fit users’ needs. Despite websites having tons of possibilities and it is what we make it into, whereas for social media, we are limited to a certain extent within the application’s frame, I do not prefer individual websites over social media. One can use different and multiple social media platforms to show different sides of themselves just like they can with multiple websites. Individual websites and social media have different purposes and functions. Typically when I browse on social media I am not looking for anything in particular, it is a way for me to relax and enjoy the content as a leisure. If I browse on a website, there is a tendency for me to look for a specific topic and learn something based on what I browsed, so the context becomes a major aspect. Living in the era with information overload, I have this stereotype with how individual websites can be only informational and not entertaining. Thus for most of the time, when I want to relax my mind, not to process any context and only look for something pleasing for the eyes, social media is the go to platform. In addition, social media allows users to be more interactive with each other. I have not seen an individual website that offers the same function as social media does so although there are overlaps with individual websites and social media, they are for different purposes and intentions so I would not advocate individual websites over the other. 

 <br><br>

A question I wonder: Schwulst states “a website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished. It’s imperfect—maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. But that’s the beauty of it”. As a user myself, I hardly notice any bugs when using websites and media, even if I do, the bugs do not enhance my experience so I cannot relate with what she means by the beauty of the idea of incompleteness.

    <p class="text"> 2.  In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.
