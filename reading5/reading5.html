In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?<br><br>


“Defamiliarize our tools”, I think she means by not being so attached to our devices, refusing to merge ourselves with our tools. She also wants us to rethink the tools we use because often our lives are surrounded by all kinds of devices that we forget we are using. The metaphor of poetry in her writing really captures the essence of trying us to be defamiliarized. Poetry is a way of communicating, just like our tools, however we are not familiar with the meaning when it is written in the form of a poem. It needs some time to be processed through. Poems seem to be such a minority in our daily life yet, it is just words arranged and used in a different way. Unlike how we perceive poems, our actions and mind become natural when it comes to the interaction with our devices. When we “defamiliarize our tools”, we will see it and interact with a new perspective.

    <p class="text"> 2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.
<br><br> 

Removing function from form in my own understanding means the object’s aesthetic quality completely takes over its use, in other words--- useless. As an environmental design student there is always a debate for “ form follows function” because the argument is around good designs for the uses and needs of people therefore, if it lacks function, it would purely be art. I think function and form should go hand in hand with each other. I always try to develop both the visual and functional aspects in my projects, especially when it comes to designing physical spaces. The example I choose below shows a chessboard that plays on its own. When I first land on the page, my natural instinct is to move around each piece because I position myself as the player. However it does not have any function of a chess game, just an animation. When technology was not developed as it is now, people can guess the function of an object by its appearance. Even with interface-skeuo design it is designed to enhance the use by having familiar real life objects. User interfaces are constantly improving to ease the use of a product, yet in this example it disobeys my behavior and has no function of its form.
