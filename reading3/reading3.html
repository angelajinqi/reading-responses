    <p class="text">1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? <br><br>

This article is well written that brings readers to think deeper (connotative and denotative) behind the meanings of the words being used in this industry which I have never thought about how one can perceive “user” verses “people” in any way. As technology evolves there is clearly a blur of boundary between users and computers just like some of the examples Lialina mentions there is wearable technology and every device is shrinking to be more like part of us. Her article does make me realize that one day in the near future or maybe even now if we have microchips being inserted into our body, then the idea of users would completely disappear. What is being left are people integrated with computers. My opinion lies on the same line as Lialina, that even “natural users” are better than “ invisible users”. Natural almost to the extent that two year olds can use ipads instinctively. When we have the idea of “user” we will design for their experience, feelings, and convenience in addition to only designing the interface. If Interface Design evolved into Experience Design, then would user experience become People Experience once the user phenomenon is gone? I agree that apart from being “users” we are people busy with something else, however it is hard to think of events where technologies are not present. For example, when one wants to ride a bike or hike in nature,  one will most likely use technology for navigation, renting or paying. Thus, although technology appears to be in all aspects of our life, one is still using it for its function and the idea of “users” should not be erased ultimately.

    <p class="text"> 2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
<br><br> 


Lialina refers to her ideal internet users as “General Purpose Users” or “Universal Users”. By General Purpose Users she means users have capacity to control over their actions in order to achieve their goal regardless of how they proceed using a device. There is no strict way of telling the user what is right or what is wrong, it all depends on the users to perform in what they believe to make most sense. An example she outlines is one can choose the medium or platform to share their life on, it does not have to be Twitter. Alternatively, the user has the capacity to post on their personal website or to use Live Journal.  Users have rights to how they use each function of the computer and should be taken into account when developing softwares. Lialina’s ideal internet user is comparable with Cooper’s “very busy user” that places user centered design in an important standing as opposed to merely having invisible users</p>

    <p class="text">3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?<br><br>

In general, I tend to have a very smooth experience when interacting with the web. However I remember as a freshman student, I had a tough time finding things I wanted on schools’ official websites. The layout and category of every school is designed differently, some have very clear headings and breakdowns. Others were all over the place and it became very frustrating browsing the website for a long time searching for the right piece of information or form. School websites should be designed to be more straightforward especially for someone that is just out of highschool, not familiar with the college system. A good example in my mind that I recall clearly is NYU’s website because the interface is designed with clear heading and division, hence I was able to achieve my objective rapidly.
